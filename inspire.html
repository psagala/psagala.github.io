    <h2>What makes a hero???????????</h2>
    <p>A hero is someone that I  admire. He is someone whos music I have turned to so many times for joy and inspiration. As a kid I have always loved his dance moves and how he gave inspiration to so many people. Michael will always be one of my top favorite singers and dancers. One of my favorite songs of his is Earth song, I love how he aknowledges the problem of climate change. </p>
    <p>He showed the world his true positve character by often performing benifit concerts, visiting sick children at hospitals, and donating to cancer and AIDS research organizations. He created music that had unifying messages and brought attention to causes that he believed in. </p>
