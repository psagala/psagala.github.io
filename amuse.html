    <h1>Mildly Amusing</h1>
    <h2>YouTube</h2>
    <p>Rudy Mancuso and Anwar Jibawi are one of my few favorite Youtubers that make me laugh. Their videos and sense of humor is hilarious. This is one of the videos that pops up whenever I feel sad and want to have alittle laugh. Anyway everyone's sense of humor is different, but maybe you'll find it hilarious as well!  To save you time, this link should skip straight to where the funniness starts in the video. At the beginning.!</p>

    <h2>Photography and Editing</h2>
    <p>I have always loved taking photos. This is one of my hobbies and passion that I love doing. The best thing about taking pictures, is editing afterwards. Oh yes! Make those raw photos into something completely different. I love to use Adobe Lightroom as it makes my pictures shine and they do not loose its definition. It is definetely amusing to me!..</p>

    <h2>Coming To America</h2>
    <p>Coming to America one thing that was a big wow to me was snow. I had never seen snow before and it was the biggest shock for me. Seeing it for the first time I had to ask my mom what it was. Eventhough I hate the cold, I find it enteresting how snow glitters when the beautiful sun hits. Mother nature is trully beautiful. I would love to see snow in a weather machine one day.
